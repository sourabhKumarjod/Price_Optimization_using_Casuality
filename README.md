Price Optimization – With the increase in 
competition, dynamic pricing is very important to 
compete on pricing with other sites. To achieve this, 
companies collect data from multiple sources, such 
as sales information, competitor pricing and customer 
actions, to determine the right price for the sale of 
products.companies do try different models and techniques to determine best price for the product and also differnt machine learning techniques to get best out of it!

Changing in Prices of doesn’t directly impact the product, but is rather effact through many individual consumer decisions to buy or not buy and also make a bad impression on the brand

To tackle this issue we can try to causal inference (randomized) experimentation: But We have to try differenct prices in different seasons it actually cost a lot to the retailer!

To know the best price is to simply analyze retailer’s history of prices and units sold over time. But estimating causal effects from observational data is difficult because of confounding. To see what this means, consider (1)Brand (2)Seasons and (3)Product Quality are important examples of many potential confounders
